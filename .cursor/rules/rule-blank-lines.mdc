Rule for Blank Lines: 
When adding a blank line for spacing, it should contain zero characters - no spaces, no tabs. Just a pure line break (\n).
To make this more specific as a coding guideline:
- A blank line is created by a single newline character
- Never add indentation (spaces/tabs) to blank lines
- When separating code blocks, use a single empty line containing only \n
This would prevent the common mistake of copying the indentation level when adding blank lines, which is what caused those trailing whitespace errors in our previous edits.
