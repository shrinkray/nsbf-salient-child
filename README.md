# NSBF WP Boilerplate

This is a [Salient child theme](https://themeforest.net/item/salient-responsive-multipurpose-theme/4363266), with:

- Laravel Mix - for frontend asset tooling
- Lots of developer friendly, handy tooling such as Dart Sass, eslint, editorconfig and more

## Requirements

For code consistency, please ensure you have the following installed in your environment/IDE:

- `editor config` (for `.editorconfig`) to share editor config for the project
- `eslint` for JS linting ([how to â†’](https://medium.com/pvtl/linting-for-react-native-bdbb586ff694#df4e))
- `npm` to compile frontend assets
